# football-ml-site

You'll need NPM installed to run this site.

Clone this project, navigate to the `backend` folder, run `npm i` to install dependencies, then run `npm start` to start the backend.

Next, navigate to the `football-site` folder, run `npm i` to install dependencies, then run `npm start` to start the frontend. It will auto open in your preferred browser.

Don't move any csv files or really any files for that matter, otherwise the backend won't work.

I use csv files as the "tables" for this project just for ease of use, as opposed to spinning up some SQL database that is contained in a docker container or something similar, etc. I realize they aren't very fast nor efficient I'm sure but it's not a ton of data, so I think this is fine.
